# Introduction

LumiJS was created for the purpose of having a simplistic yet useful game/physics engine. It is object-oriented, and has many components that you can tweak and modify. If you have any ideas for a new feature, please submit an "enhancement" issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/FuriousTsunami/LumiJS).
